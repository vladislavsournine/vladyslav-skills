# QSave

**Type:** Engineer (light)
**Requires:** MemPalace MCP server

Frictionless one-shot capture of the most recent decision, problem, or milestone into the current project's MemPalace wing. Unlike `/save`, it asks **no questions** — it reads what just happened from the conversation and files it. Unlike `compact-save`, it stores *semantic knowledge*, not task-resume state, and does **not** wait for context compaction.

This exists because the `SessionEnd` auto-miner only fires when a session ends, and `compact-save` only fires on compaction — so a quick fix in the middle of a long session would otherwise sit uncaptured until then. `qsave` closes that gap on demand.

## When this runs

- User says `/vladyslav:qsave`, `/qsave`, "quick save", "qsave this", "швидко збережи", "qsave"
- **Proactively offered** by the assistant when it judges a substantive task complete and a concrete decision/problem/milestone emerged (see the global `CLAUDE.md` rule). The user must accept — `qsave` never writes unprompted.

## Steps

### Step 1: Detect wing

Derive the wing from the working-directory **basename** (preserve case; replace whitespace/underscores/dots with single hyphens; do NOT lowercase, do NOT add a stack prefix), then confirm it against the wings list in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. This matches `scripts/derive-wing.sh` and the `SessionEnd` miner. If the basename is not in the wings list and the directory is clearly outside a known project, ask the user to confirm the wing in one line — otherwise proceed silently.

### Step 2: Extract content from the conversation — no questions

Read the recent conversation and pull out the single most salient item to record. Do not interrogate the user. Classify the room:

- **decision** — a choice that was made with rationale ("we switched X to Y because Z")
- **problem** — a bug, gotcha, or constraint that surfaced
- **milestone** — a "this now works / shipped" moment

Default to `decision` when ambiguous. If genuinely nothing record-worthy happened, say so in one line and stop — do not invent content.

### Step 3: Write to MemPalace

Call `mempalace_add_drawer` (it duplicate-checks before writing) with:

- `wing`: detected wing
- `room`: `decision` / `problem` / `milestone`
- `added_by`: `vlad`
- `content`: the standard record shape from `_shared/references/mempalace-record.md`:

```
[WHAT] <one keyword-rich sentence — what changed / what broke / what shipped>
[WHY] <one sentence — the driver, if known>
[FILES] <up to 5 absolute paths touched; omit the line if irrelevant>
[DATE] <today's date, ISO 8601>
```

Omit `[WHY]` / `[FILES]` if not applicable. Keep it to those four lines — `qsave` is for searchable atoms, not narrative.

### Step 4: Confirm

Output exactly one line:

`qsaved → wing:<wing>  room:<room>  "<slug>"`

## Failure modes

- **MemPalace unreachable** → one-line warning, suggest noting it manually. Never block.
- **Wing undetectable AND outside a known project** → ask once, in one line. Never guess a wing silently.
