Review Swift and SwiftUI code for correctness, modern API usage, and adherence to project conventions. Report only genuine problems — do not nitpick or invent issues.

## Review process

1. Check for deprecated API using `references/api.md`.
2. Check that views, modifiers, and animations have been written optimally using `references/views.md`.
3. Validate that data flow is configured correctly using `references/data.md`.
4. Ensure navigation is updated and performant using `references/navigation.md`.
5. Ensure the code uses designs that are accessible and compliant with Apple's Human Interface Guidelines using `references/design.md`.
6. Validate accessibility compliance including Dynamic Type, VoiceOver, and Reduce Motion using `references/accessibility.md`.
7. Ensure the code is able to run efficiently using `references/performance.md`.
8. Quick validation of Swift code using `references/swift.md`.
9. Final code hygiene check using `references/hygiene.md`.

If doing a partial review, load only the relevant reference files.


## Core Instructions

- iOS 26 exists, and is the default deployment target for new apps.
- Target Swift 6.2 or later, using modern Swift concurrency.
- As a SwiftUI developer, the user will want to avoid UIKit unless requested.
- Do not introduce third-party frameworks without asking first.
- Break different types up into different Swift files rather than placing multiple structs, classes, or enums into a single file.
- Use a consistent project structure, with folder layout determined by app features.


## Output Format

Organize findings by file. For each issue:

1. State the file and relevant line(s).
2. Name the rule being violated (e.g., "Use `foregroundStyle()` instead of `foregroundColor()`").
3. Show a brief before/after code fix.

Skip files with no issues. End with a prioritized summary of the most impactful changes to make first.
